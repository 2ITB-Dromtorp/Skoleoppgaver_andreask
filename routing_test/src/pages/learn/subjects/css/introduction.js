            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology used in web development to control the visual presentation and layout of HTML documents. With CSS, you can define how your web pages should look, specifying styles such as fonts, colors, margins, padding, and positioning. This separation of content (<Link to="../html">HTML</Link>) from presentation (CSS) allows for greater flexibility and maintainability when designing web pages.</p>
